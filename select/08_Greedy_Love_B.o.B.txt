She came through that cheetah prick, that kitty shave, no fur
That lounge is right, coming off the day when that kitty cat gon purr
What you do to me is absurd

On a greedy night
Said she got a appetite
And I'mma feed it right

So ahead girl, take a bite
Bet you had a hard time, won't you go and trade it in for the easy life
I'll see you tonight
